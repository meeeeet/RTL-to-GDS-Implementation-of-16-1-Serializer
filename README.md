# RTL to GDS Implementation of 16:1 Serializer
#### Abstract:
This project showcases the design and implementation of a 16:1 on-chip digital serializer using advanced 7nm FinFET 
technology. The serializer is essential for high-performance System-on-Chip (SoC) designs, enabling efficient and reliable data 
transmission. By leveraging OpenROAD, an automated and open-source RTL to GDS design tool, the serializer achieves 
optimized physical-level performance. Results include a power dissipation of 7.9 mW, a high-speed data transmission rate of 6.8 
Gbps, and occupying only 14% of the chip area. This demonstrates the efficacy of OpenROAD and 7nm FinFET technology, 
providing unmatched performance and integration in on-chip digital serializer designs.
